# Goals from this data
- Find out who the CEOs for all firms we are studying
- Find out if the same CEOs were at the firms between 2018 and 2020. If not, find that info.
- Research if any of the CEOs have personal Twitter accounts versus main company account.

## Once the above is obtained:
- Graph showing volume of all stocks, 2018-2020
- Pinpoint the top three days of highest volume for each stock
    - Study the day (+- 3 days) of highest volume and look at the CEO's personal tweets
    - Find two CEOs with the most twitter incidents with high volume
    - graph the tweets vs. volume 

#Important:
- We are investigating if a CEO's personal tweets affects the stock of his or her company. We are looking at Twitter posts only because:
    - we can tell before and after a few days after a post if there was an affect of the stock
    - whereas, a scandal with a CEO can take days, weeks, months, even years to resolve. It is much more difficult to see patterns due to that length of time.
